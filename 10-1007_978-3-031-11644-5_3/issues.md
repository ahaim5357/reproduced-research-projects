## Issues

* As stated in the repository, the randomness is not seeded, so TQuiz and CQuiz is not recoverable.
* None of the other images or data is recoverable as well the generated quizzes could change the sample size as they were random and that some data was collected directly from users which was not included, likely due to personally identifiable information.

The status is set to 'Mostly Not Reproducible' as the only recoverable results are those used in the demos. We have no way to verify whether the generated data for the intervention were the same used in the experiment, although we did purposely make it so the script would generate the data regardless.
