## Issues

### Table 1

The results tend to be within the confidence intervals provided when running the experiment multiple times. Three results, however, seem to be extremes which do not fit into the confidence interval. After 10 runs, the best measures and bounds have been provided below:

* Wald (m = 30, n = 20): 1.000 +- 0.000 -> 0.996 +- 0.010
* Barrier (m = 100, n = 20): 0.059 +- 0.012 -> 0.077 +- 0.030
* Barrier (m = 500, n = 20): 0.097 +- 0.016 -> 0.080 +- 0.021

### Figure 3

The runtime graphs will differ depending on the machine used, so the results are inconsistent. However, the reported line plots are similar in relation to the other experimental conditions.
